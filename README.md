# 🐝 Buzz Bombers – C++ SFML Game Project

A first-semester game development project built using **C++** and **SFML**. This version captures the core mechanics and brings them to life with smooth controls, multiple levels, and an engaging arcade-style gameplay loop.

## Game Objective

Control a **spray can** to defend your garden from waves of bees. Spray them before they pollinate flowers and trap you. Sprayed bees turn into honeycombs, which your friendly hummingbird collects for bonus points.

Survive waves, collect honeycombs, avoid killer bees, and keep your spray levels in check!

## 🕹️ Features

### ✅ Core Mechanics
- Spray bees using the spray can to prevent them from pollinating flowers.
- Yellow bees = Worker bees, turn into **Yellow Honeycombs**
- White bees = Killer bees, turn into **Red Honeycombs**
- A **Hummingbird** collects honeycombs for extra points.
- Beehives are formed when worker bees are trapped and reward big points.
- Flowers grow and restrict movement; getting trapped means losing a spray can.

---

## 🐝 Bee Movement

- Bees fly in tiers and bounce off screen edges or honeycombs.
- Worker bees drop tiers more frequently.
- Killer bees are faster and only drop tiers when hitting the screen edge.
- If bees reach the bottom, **pollination starts** and flowers grow.

## 🐦 The Hummingbird

- Collects honeycombs for bonus points.
- Avoid spraying her—too much spray and she temporarily leaves the screen.
